What did you learn?
In this assignment, I learned that using more space on the page creates a more appealing and
easier to read program. I also learned more about how loops work and that programs have
limits to what they can calculate.

What were the challenges if any?
One big challenge I had was when I put my error notice in the wrong place on my loop.
It popped up each time I ran the program until I finally figured it out!
